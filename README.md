# bigdata-enterprise-play

Some more in-depth technologies to create a big data solution:

## Cluster Manager

In order to achive all the big data tasks, we need to enable a cluster manager like Kubernetes, Apache Mesos and Hadoop YARN.

## Security 

Use some tools that can provide authorization and authentication capabilities to provide more security to the cluster (Kerberos, Apache Ranger, Apache Sentry).

## Workflow

So all of these steps can be clubbed into a workflow to run automatically using some workflow manager like Apache Airflow and Oozie (this is not recommended).
